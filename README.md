Testing Functional Code Kata
============================

This project contains some functional code, in the "TrigMath" class. For this Kata, your should write
unit tests for these functions. You could add your test cases in "TrigMathTest".

You should use a code coverage tool (for example http://emma.sourceforge.net/) to help you to design test cases -
your goal is 100% coverage.

You could also use an approval testing tool (for example http://approvaltests.com/)
